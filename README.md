# Credit Risk Classification

### Using Machine Learning Models

> In this machine learning model I will train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I am working with a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The machine learning model used for this is  `LogisticRegression.`
